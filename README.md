# Project Structure

Quick breakdown of how the project is structured, how routing works, and how we showcase everything on the frontend.

### The Entry Point
Everything starts at `src/main.tsx`. Wrap the app in a `QueryClientProvider` (for any future API work) and kick off the `RouterProvider`.

### Routing (`src/router.tsx`)
Using React Router's `createBrowserRouter`. 
- The base path (`/`) is wrapped in `MainLayout`.
- Use **lazy loading** for the `HomePage`. Helps to keeps the initial bundle size small—the browser only grabs the home page code when it actually needs it.

### The Frame (`src/components/MainLayout.tsx`)
Ensures `Header` and `Footer` are always visible. The `<Outlet />` is a placeholder where whatever page you're visiting gets injected.

### Component System
The `HomePage.tsx` is just a coordinator that pulls in individual sections from the `src/components/` folder:

- **Interactive stuff**: Most animations are inside `HeroAnimations.tsx`. 
- **The Grids**: `Features.tsx` handles main value props and 
- **The Modal**: `Contact.tsx` handles lead gen form via EmailJS intergration.

### Tech Stack / Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: For all the styling. Global tokens (like colors and blur effects) live in `src/index.css`.
- **Framer Motion**: For animations (fades, slides of the modals).
- **Iconify**: For icons without bloating the project with SVG files.
